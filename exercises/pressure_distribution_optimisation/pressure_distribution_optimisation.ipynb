    "# Simulation and optimisation of pressure distribution in a combustion chamber\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is concerned with the simulation and optimisation of pressure distribution within a combustion chamber to ensure efficient fuel combustion and enhance engine performance. The design and optimisation of pressure distribution are crucial for achieving a uniform distribution, and this analysis involves simulating how various burner configurations affect the pressure distribution. The study utilises a two-dimensional model that balances computational efficiency with accuracy, making it applicable to various engineering fields where combustion efficiency is critical."

    "## Problem formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyse the pressure distribution within a combustion chamber, a mathematical model is developed based on fundamental principles of fluid dynamics. This formulation encapsulates the effects of burner configurations on pressure distribution and provides a basis for optimising the chamber's design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Governing equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The pressure distribution within the combustion chamber is governed by the Poisson equation, describing pressure variations due to burner sources:\n",

    "5. The chamber walls are assumed to have fixed boundary conditions, ensuring a well-posed numerical solution.  \n",
