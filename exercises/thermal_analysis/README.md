# Analysis of the thermal effects of a lightning strike on a structural element

This exercise investigates the thermal effects of a lightning strike on a structural element, with a focus on heat distribution and the associated risks of fire and structural damage. Lightning strikes, with temperatures reaching up to 30,000 K, transfer substantial thermal energy to the affected structure, generating extreme thermal gradients that may compromise material integrity. The analysis involves modelling the propagation of heat from the point of impact, identifying temperature hotspots, and assessing the risks of thermally induced material failure or ignition. To ensure a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, the study adopts a simplified two-dimensional model, such as a metal panel. This approach is applicable to various fields, including aerospace, construction, and energy systems, where resilience to lightning strikes is a critical consideration.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this exercise are:

1. **Heat distribution analysis**: Simulate and visualise the distribution of heat across the structure immediately after the lightning strike, focusing on the temperature variations over time and space.

2. **Temperature gradient assessment**: Evaluate the temperature gradients within the material, identifying regions of steep change that may be prone to structural weakening or failure.

3. **Risk evaluation**: Assess the risk of fire and structural damage based on the temperature profiles and gradients. This involves determining whether the material's temperature exceeds critical thresholds for ignition or deformation.

## Methodology

The methodology follows these structured steps:

1. **Initial and boundary conditions**: Define the structure as a two-dimensional metal panel with known thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density. A point source of heat represents the lightning strike. Boundary conditions account for heat dissipation to the surrounding environment.

2. **Heat conduction equation**: Solve the two-dimensional transient heat conduction equation to model the temperature distribution over time. This includes accounting for material properties and boundary conditions such as heat dissipation to the environment.

3. **Numerical simulation**: Implement a numerical method, such as finite difference or finite element analysis, to compute the temperature distribution across the structure over time.

4. **Visualisation and analysis**: Generate temperature distribution plots over time to visualise the spread of heat from the impact point. Assess temperature gradients to identify regions prone to structural weakening or ignition.

## Testing the system

The exercise includes several test scenarios to validate the system and explore its behaviour under varying conditions:

1. **Uniform material test**: A simulation is conducted on a uniform material panel with standardised thermal properties. This test assesses the basic heat distribution and ensures that the solution conforms to expected thermal behaviour.

2. **Heterogeneous material test**: A second simulation introduces variability in material properties, such as regions with different thermal conductivities. This test evaluates the model's robustness in handling heterogeneous structures.

3. **Boundary condition test**: Adjust boundary conditions, such as heat dissipation rates, to simulate varying environmental effects. This test validates the system's flexibility in adapting to different scenarios.

4. **Custom configuration test**: Input custom material properties, lightning intensity, and environmental conditions to explore different scenarios and their impact on heat propagation and risks.
