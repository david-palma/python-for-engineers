# Installation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up the required environment for exploring and running the exercises provided in the **Python for Engineers** repository. Please ensure you follow the steps precisely to avoid any issues during installation.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

1. **Python Installation**

   - Python version 3.8 or higher is required.
   - To verify if Python is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and execute:

     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

     or

     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

   - If Python is not installed, download the latest version from the official Python website:
     [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Jupyter Notebook**

   - Jupyter Notebook is the platform used to run and interact with the exercises.
   - It is recommended to install Jupyter via a Python package manager such as `pip` or within a virtual environment.

3. **Package Manager (pip)**
   - Ensure that `pip`, the Python package manager, is installed. To verify, execute:

     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```

   - If `pip` is not available, refer to the official guide to install it:
     [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/david-palma/python-for-engineers.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd python-for-engineers
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (optional)

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies independently. Execute the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

#### **Windows**

1. Create the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

#### **Unix-like**

1. Create the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

Once the virtual environment is activated, the terminal or command prompt should display a prefix indicating the environment is active (e.g., `venv`).

#### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When finished working, deactivate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
deactivate
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

The repository includes a `requirements.txt` file that specifies all the Python libraries and packages required to run the exercises. Install these dependencies using the following steps:

1. Ensure that you are in the root directory of the repository.

   ```bash
   cd python-for-engineers
   ```

2. If you have activated a virtual environment (optional but recommended), ensure it is active. Refer to Step 2 for details on activating the virtual environment.
3. Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install libraries such as:

   - numpy (for numerical computations),
   - matplotlib (for visualisations),
   - pandas (for data manipulation),
   - scipy (for advanced computations),
   - Additional libraries required for specific exercises.

### 4. Verify the Installation

To ensure all dependencies are correctly installed, execute the following command to list installed packages:

```bash
pip list
```

Alternatively, test the setup by running a Jupyter Notebook.

## Running the Exercises

### 1. Launch Jupyter Notebook

Start the Jupyter Notebook server by executing:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

A browser window should open automatically, displaying the Jupyter interface. Navigate to the `case-studies/` folder and select a exercise notebook (e.g., `01-gear-wear-analysis.ipynb`) to open.

### 2. Execute the Notebook

Once the notebook opens:

- Read the introductory section to understand the context of the exercise.
- Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results and visualisations.

## Running Exercises in Visual Studio Code (Alternative)

If you prefer using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** to explore and run the exercises, follow the steps below to set up and run the notebooks effectively.

#### 1. Install Visual Studio Code

#### 3. Open the Repository in VS Code

1. Open VS Code and select **File > Open Folder...** to open the `python-for-engineers` repository directory.
2. Alternatively, you can open the terminal in the repository directory and execute:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

#### 4. Open and Run a Exercise

1. In the VS Code Explorer (left-hand side), navigate to the `case-studies/` folder.
2. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., `01-gear-wear-analysis.ipynb`).
3. If prompted, select the Python interpreter associated with your virtual environment.
   - You will see a notification at the top-right of the VS Code interface to select the interpreter.
4. Run the cells sequentially by clicking the Run button (â–º) at the top of each cell or using the toolbar controls provided for notebooks.

#### 5. Debugging and Troubleshooting

To debug Python scripts or cells in a Jupyter Notebook:

- Add breakpoints in the code by clicking to the left of the line numbers.
- Use the Run and Debug feature in VS Code, accessible from the Activity Bar on the side.

## Troubleshooting

While setting up and running the exercises, you may encounter some issues. Below are common problems and their solutions to help you resolve them.

### 1. Jupyter Notebook Not Launching

**Problem**: Running `jupyter notebook` results in an error or no action.

**Solution**:

- Ensure that you have installed Jupyter in your environment by running:

  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  ```

- If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running the command.
- Try upgrading Jupyter with:

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade notebook
  ```

### 2. Missing Dependencies or ModuleNotFoundError

**Problem**: When running a notebook, you encounter a `ModuleNotFoundError` for a missing package.

**Solution**:

- Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Verify the correct virtual environment is activated (if using one).
- Check the specific module mentioned in the error and install it manually:

  ```bash
  pip install <module_name>
  ```

### 3. Issues with Visual Studio Code Extensions

**Problem**: The Jupyter Notebook does not run as expected in Visual Studio Code.

**Solution**:

- Ensure that both the **Python** and **Jupyter** extensions are installed in VS Code, as described in the instructions provided in section [Running Exercises in Visual Studio Code](#running-case-studies-in-visual-studio-code-alternative).
- If notebooks do not open correctly, try reloading the window:
    - Click on **View > Command Palette**, then type and select **Reload Window**.
- Ensure that the correct Python interpreter is selected. You should see a notification at the top-right of the VS Code interface to choose the interpreter. Select the one associated with your virtual environment (if using one).

### 4. Kernel or Runtime Errors in Jupyter Notebooks

**Problem**: You receive an error like "Kernel Restarting" or similar when executing cells in Jupyter.

**Solution**:

- This often occurs when dependencies are not installed correctly. Ensure all required packages are installed with:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- If using a virtual environment, ensure it is active.
- Restart the Jupyter kernel by selecting **Kernel > Restart** in the notebook interface.

### 5. Virtual Environment Issues

**Problem**: The virtual environment is not activating properly.

**Solution**:

- Ensure you are in the correct directory when trying to activate the virtual environment.
- On **Windows**, use:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **Unix-like** systems, use:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

  If the environment still fails to activate, recreate it by deleting the `venv/` folder and running:
- On **Windows**

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```

- On **Unix-like** systems

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  ```

### 6. Dependency Version Conflicts

**Problem**: Conflicting versions of dependencies cause errors or unexpected behaviour.

**Solution**:

- Check the versions of installed dependencies using:

  ```bash
  pip list
  ```

- If a conflict exists, try upgrading or downgrading the specific package to match the required version:

  ```bash
  pip install <module_name>==<desired_version>
  ```

### 7. Visualisation Not Displaying Correctly

**Problem**: Plots or graphs do not render in the notebook or show as blank figures.

**Solution**:

- Ensure that you have the necessary plotting libraries installed, such as `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.
- In Jupyter, ensure you include the following magic command at the beginning of the notebook to enable inline plotting:

  ```python
  %matplotlib inline
  ```

- Check that the notebook cells are being executed in the correct order, as plots may rely on variables created in previous cells.

### 8. Performance Issues

**Problem**: The exercises run slowly or consume excessive resources.

**Solution**:

- Ensure that your environment meets the system requirements for running the exercises, especially for more complex simulations.
- Close other applications to free up system resources.
- For large computations, consider breaking down the problem into smaller chunks or using more efficient algorithms.

### General Installation Issues

**Problem**: If you face any other installation or setup issues not addressed here, consider the following steps:

**Solution**:

- Ensure that Python is correctly installed by running:

```bash
python --version
```

- Ensure that `pip` is up-to-date by running:

  ```bash
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

- Review any error messages carefully for additional clues or missing dependencies.
